- pretty up the error display and make sure the sign makes sense
    - use wavy-equals as the symbol (inside a circle?)
    - on tap, pop up a tooltip with the exact figure and error
- add more unit tests
- add UI tests
- prevent input if it doesn't make sense in that place (a la the regular Calculator app)
    - consider reformatting input with pretty fractions as-you-type so you can see how it's being parsed
- color palette and then test dark mode
- how does it behave on other device form factors?
- what to do about negative values?
- add toggle for rounding mode (feet + inches or just inches)
- clear button should turn to backspace when input is not empty
    - a la calculator app, holding it should delete everything
- show visual feedback when tapping a button
- pretty frations: parser has to be able to read them, or keep a non-pretty version of it under the hood
    - probably easiest to support parsing them properly so that copy-paste works
